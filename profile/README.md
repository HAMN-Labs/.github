### Building Shared Intelligence Infrastructure for AI Agents

HAMN Labs develops infrastructure that enables AI agents and decentralized applications to **reuse intelligence instead of recomputing it**.

We are building the memory layer for Web3 AI.

---

## 🚀 Flagship Project — HAMN Protocol

**HAMN Protocol** is a decentralized associative memory network running on Arbitrum.

It allows AI agents to:

• store successful solutions  
• reuse intelligence across agents  
• reward contributors for useful knowledge  

Result:

3.2s recomputation → 20ms recall


Up to **160× acceleration** through shared memory.

## 🧩 What We Build

HAMN Labs focuses on infrastructure for:

• decentralized AI systems  
• shared agent intelligence  
• Web3 compute layers  
• agent coordination networks  
• intelligence marketplaces  

---

## 🏗 Technology Stack

Core technologies used across HAMN projects:

• Rust high-performance engines  
• Arbitrum & Stylus smart contracts  
• Solidity protocol layer  
• TypeScript SDKs  
• decentralized node infrastructure  

---

## 🌍 Vision

Future AI systems will not operate in isolation.

Agents will share memory, reuse experience, and collaborate through decentralized intelligence networks.

HAMN Labs is building this foundation.
